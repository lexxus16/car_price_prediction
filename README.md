# Car Price Prediction

## Introduction

This project is centered around the task of predicting car prices for an automobile company, using the Random Forest Regressor. It addresses a multiple linear regression problem, aiming to model the relationship between various features and the target variable, the price of cars. The dataset utilized in this project can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction/data). 

### Problem Statement

1. **Key Variables:**
   - Identify the variables crucial for predicting car prices in the American market.

2. **Model Performance:**
   - Assess how well these variables describe and predict car prices.

- **wheelbase:** Distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels.
- **enginesize:** Size of the car's engine.
- **fuelsystem:** Type of fuel delivery system used in the car.
- **boreratio:** Ratio of the cylinder bore's diameter to the piston stroke length.
- **stroke:** Length of the piston stroke in the car's engine.
- **compressionratio:** Ratio of the volume of the cylinder and combustion chamber when the piston is at the bottom of its stroke to the volume when the piston is at the top of its stroke.
- **horsepower:** The power of the car's engine, measured in horsepower.
- **peakrpm:** The maximum revolutions per minute (RPM) at which the engine operates.
- **citympg:** The number of miles the car can travel per gallon of fuel in city driving conditions.
